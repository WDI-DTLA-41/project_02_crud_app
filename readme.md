### The Get Go Of this Project's Progression

> First idea was to make a Kappa Counter which tracks a word used in a
  real time chat log but that will be a future project. Doing this, was
  unsure how to monitor chat consistently plus it was more of a self
  use app idea.

> Second idea was to make a real time chat room but realized after day1
  that I should focus on learning db/route/CRUD first. Will want to
  eventually incorporate this later on.

> Third idea(this) is a blog/forum where anyone can create, read, edit,
  and delete theirs and each other's posts while hiding names. Also with
  the ability to upVote or downVote but not with a counter, you can see
  if someone likes/dislikes that comment by that person. Clicking one will
  also toggle the other one off so at any point past opinions can be
  overwritten. A counter will eventually be made for this.

> Used Bootstrap as the CSS framework after looking over a few, concept
  wise the idea is very helpful and the layout of using columns can help
  when wanting to put a lot of individual content in specific areas. For
  my current project, I did not require too much so will probably touch
  back up on this later when I add more features to continue on this idea.

> Template wise, used handlebars, pros and cons while learning to
  implement it but can see why it's great for understanding the value of
  why templating is important in situations. Enjoyed learning EJS more
  and wish I incorporated it instead but for the sake of learning, based
  off handlebars. Will approach this later.

> Realized over hours and hours that targeting with ._id is most efficient
  rather than somehow trying to find->sort->remove. Idea behind this was
  to remove the most recent document added into collection by sorting,
  finding it, and then remove which targets the last document. Lot of flaws
  with this as it doesn't specifically let you target any document within
  the collection.

> Tried making everything on one page rather than a few and learned how
  that was a terrible idea as many things overlap and can break.

> Theme/Layout kept changing throughout the progression of each button.
  Using wireframe helped to incorporate my changes beforehand to see
  what layout will look like before making changes.

> I see value in this in a more advanced state with features that include:
  login/password, comments on posts, '/' display could use more real-time.
