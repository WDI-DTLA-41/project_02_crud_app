- The Get Go Of this Project's Progression

> First idea was to make a Kappa Counter which tracks a word used in a
  real time chat log but that will be a future project

> Second idea was to make a real time chat room but realized after day1
  that I should focus on learning db/route/CRUD first

> Third idea(this) is a blog/forum where anyone can create, read, edit,
  and delete theirs and each other's posts while hiding names

> Used Bootstrap as the CSS framework after looking over a few, don't
  like it too much so will play with others for future ideas.

> Template wise, used handlebars, pros and cons while learning to
  implement it but can see why it's great for understanding the value of
  why templating is important in situations

> Realized over hours and hours that targeting with ._id is most efficient
  rather than somehow trying to find->sort->remove

> Tried making everything on one page rather than a few and learned how
  that was a terrible idea as many things overlap and can break

> Theme/Layout kept changing throughout the progression of each button

> I see value in this in a more advanced state with features that include:
  login/password, comments on posts, '/' display could use more real-time.
