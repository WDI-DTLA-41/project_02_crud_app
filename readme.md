Your repo MUST
- Include wireframes that you designed during the planning process
- Include user stories

Necessary Deliverables

- A working full-stack application, built by you, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
- A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project. Commit early, commit often.
- A readme.md file with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
- Wireframes of your app, hosted somewhere & linked in your readme
- A link in your readme.md to the publically-accessible user stories you created

Suggested Ways to Get Started

- Plan
- Write User stories

> User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application. 
> It's tempting to just make them todo lists for what needs to get done, 
> but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, 
> it'll help you know what to build!

- Pseudo code
- Wireframe
- Write naive code
- Read the docs
- Find a tutorial
- Commit early, commit often.
- Use git branching to try out ideas

# Potential Project Ideas

### Personal Tracker

Build something for yourself that tracks some data!

### Cheerups

The world is a depressing place.

Your task is to create an app that will allow people to create and share "cheerups" - 
happy little quips to brighten other peoples' days. Cheerups will be small - 
limited to 139 characters. Members will be able to promote Cheerups that they like 
and maybe even boost the reputation of the Cheerupper.

### Bookmarket

You will create an application where users can bookmark links they want to keep.

But what if users could trade bookmarks for other bookmarks? Or sell bookmarks for points? 
Or send bookmarks to your friends. Or something even crazier.

### FourSquare Clone

MongoDB is great for location based data like latitude and longitude.
Allow users to report on their location and find nearby friends.
